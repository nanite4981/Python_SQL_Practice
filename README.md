# Overview


- I wrote software that interacts with a SQL Relational Database that contains two tables. It has a table for users' public information and users' private information. You follow the input prompts and navigate the two tables.

- I wrote this software to refamiliarize myself with SQL and relational databases. I forget my coding skills over time, and I wanted to relearn stuff that I work with on MySQl.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

- I am using the SQLite database that works as a Python module.

- I have two small tables. They both have a username element and an INTEGER element, but the INTEGER elements are distinct.

# Development Environment

- I developed my software with Python and the SQLite3 module in Visual Studio Code.

# Future Work

- Add additional methods
- Add more activity to the program
- Find a cleaner way to code the table swap
